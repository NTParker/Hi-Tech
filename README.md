# Hi-Tech

https://calm-island-22808.herokuapp.com/

This application is a fictional tech blog where users are able to publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app utilizes the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
